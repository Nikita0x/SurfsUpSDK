# Exporting the Map

Once you've completed your map's layout and want to test it in-game, we'll need to **export** the Map to a PCK file
First, go to `Project -> Tools -> [SurfsUp] SDK Tools -> Set Maps Directory`
![SDK Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bearlikelion/SurfsUpSDK/refs/heads/main/docs/assets/img/exporting/sdk_tools.png)

Set your **Maps Directory** export next to the **SurfsUp Executable**
![Maps Directory]((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bearlikelion/SurfsUpSDK/refs/heads/main/docs/assets/img/exporting/set_maps_dir.png))

Once the maps directory is set, press the **Export Map Button in the top right** of the editor.

Then you can [load your map in-game](testing.md)
