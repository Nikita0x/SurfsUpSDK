# Testing the Map in Game

Once exported, you can launch SurfsUp, press (tilde) to open the dev console, and type:
	`map <map_name>`

The `<map_name>` should be the filename of the exported PCK with the same Level\<map_name>.tscn file
The game will create a private lobby for testing and load you into the map
