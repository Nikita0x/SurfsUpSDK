# Texturing the Ramps

Once the ramps are placed in a scene, you can begin to texture them.
The SDK Project has some Standard Material textures already supplied in `Assets\Textures`, but feel free to add your own!

First, right click on a ramp prefab and enable **Editable Children**

Then find a StanardMaterial.tres you like, Example: `Assets\Textures\Bricks098\Bricks098.tres`
Drag the Material onto the ramp where you enabled editable children
