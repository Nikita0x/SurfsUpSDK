# Using the Ramp Prefabs

Under the `Levels\Ramps\Parts` you will find .glb files of ramp prefabs with collision to use in map maping

Simply drag and drop these GLB files into the `Level` node, then position, rotate, and scale appropriately.

There is an example character under `Assets\Characters\Y-Bot\Y Bot.tscn` to check scale.
You can use the **View Gizmo** in the top right of the viewport to focus the camera on the X/Y/Z axis
